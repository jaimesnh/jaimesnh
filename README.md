### 👋 Hi there, welcome to my profile!
I’m a **Software Engineering student** at Universidad Rey Juan Carlos (URJC, Madrid), currently in my third year.<br>
My studies have provided me with a strong foundation in mathematics, programming, and algorithms, while also giving me a deep understanding of the software development lifecycle, from design and architecture to quality and security.<br><br>
I’m especially passionate about Artificial Intelligence (neural networks) and algorithmic problem solving. I’ve also participated in competitive programming contests, such as ADAByron 2025 (Madrid), where I challenged myself in advanced algorithm design and optimization.

### 📚 Academic Background

Here are some key areas that have shaped my knowledge and skills:

- **Mathematics & Logic:**  
  Calculus, statistics, algebra, discrete mathematics, and formal logic.

- **Programming:**  
  Fundamentals, data structures, object-oriented programming (OOP), and advanced programming methodologies.

- **Algorithms:**  
  Design, analysis, optimization, and operations research.

- **Software Engineering:**
